        It has been a wild ride learning with you Joe (TurtleTurt). For the four years that I was a part of Code Nation, you were constantly there to guide me and help me along my journey as both a high schooler but also as a future developer. As most of us join Code Nation without much prior knowledge of coding, and often under unfortunate familial situations, I thank you for your patience and dedication to helping every single student learn how to code and make the best of their time at Code Nation. I wish you the best in your married life and thank you so much for asking for the donations to Code Nation.
      </p>
    
      <h5 class="name"><b>From: Lisandro Mayancela</b></h5>
      <p class="stories">
        Being a part of ScriptEd (Now Code Nation) has allowed me to not only gain skills in the field I 
        have always wanted to pursue, but it has also allowed me to work with a host of inspiring developers 
        in the field, with the most influencial, of course, being you. In the time that I was at Google, it 
        was always a blessing to have you there to assist us in learning the many complex faccets of Computer 
        Science. Even when you weren't there, as you had to travel for your own projects, I still felt your 
        presence as I aspired, and still aspire, to reach a point in my career where I get to travel doing what 
        I love much like yourself. I want to thank you for all that you've done for us and for Code Nation and 
        I wish you nothing but happiness and joy as you move onto the next stage of your life with the person 
        you love. I would wish you good luck on your future endeavors but I know that with your charisma, work 
        ethic, and kind nature luck will always be on your side.
      </p>

        I can't believe its been 2 years since I first met you. Being a fellow Googler under your teaching has shown me that anything is possible if you put time and effort into it. Through the years of 2016 and 2017, I was able to absorb the essential information a future coder like me would need to propser in the CS field. I want to thank you for the time you've spent with us to not only teach but inspire us to continue. I wish that everything in life goes well for you, that happiness and love are always with you, and may the love you share today grow stronger as you grow old with your wife. I hope you have an amazing married life and would only hope that you will always remember us.

        <p>Code Nation equips students in under-resourced high schools with the skills, experiences, and connections that together create access to careers in technology.</p>
        <p>Four out of five students who pursue tech careers decide to do so in high school, but young people growing up in low-income circumstances have</p>
